Update 15/01


File Structure:
Cepheids: /storage/teaching/TelescopeGroupProject/2025-26/Cepheids/ -> night dates
Calibration Frames: /storage/teaching/TelescopeGroupProject/2026-26/Calibrations/week#/binning1x1 -> files

Binning is always the same.
Code from reduction_pipeline_skeleton needs to be reviewed and ported into reduction_pipeline.
